# My CS:S Config

This is my personal config for Counter-Strike Source.

I've also included my HUD, which is a basic modification of the vanilla CS:S HUD.

I modified 2 files for this HUD.

* Line 279 and 282 of `clientscheme.res`, adding a dropshadow and disabling anti-aliasing of the font used in deathnotices.
* Line 390 of `hudlayout.res`, changing the max deathnotices that can be shown to 6 from the default 4. This is useful for aces.
